Association,  a  non-profit  organization  with  seat  in  Linköping,  Sweden.  Modelica  is  a  freely
available,  object-oriented  language  for  modeling  of  large,  complex,  and  heterogeneous  physical
systems.  It  is  suited  for  multi-domain  modeling,  for  example,  mechatronic  models  in  robotics,
automotive  and  aerospace  applications  involving  mechanical,  electrical,  hydraulic  and  control
subsystems, process oriented applications and generation and distribution of electric power. Models
in  Modelica  are  mathematically  described  by  differential,  algebraic  and  discrete  equations.  No
particular variable needs to be solved for manually. A Modelica tool will have enough information
to decide that automatically. Modelica is designed such that available, specialized algorithms can be
utilized  to  enable  efficient  handling  of  large  models  having  more  than  one  hundred  thousand
equations.  Modelica  is  suited  and  used  for  hardware-in-the-loop  simulations  and  for  embedded
control systems. More information is available at http://www.Modelica.org/

Version 3.2 Revision 2 clarifies and fixes issues of the specification text. Furthermore, it adds
a few new features to Version 3.2 Revision 1, in order that the Modelica Standard Library version 3.2.1 is
fully compliant to the Modelica Language Version 3.2 Revision 2.

Version 3.2 Revision 1 defines exactly the same language as Version 3.2. It just clarifies and fixes
several issues of the specification text.},
